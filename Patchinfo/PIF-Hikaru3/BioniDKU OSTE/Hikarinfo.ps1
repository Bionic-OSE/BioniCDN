 This last update to your image brings it to revision (23020.)107, which includes apps updates and some other final
 quality fixes. 
 This update requires you to have the latest special standalone update package installed (don't worry, most of you 
 did). This package is published in the announcement channel, so if you haven't, please do so before installing 
 this update (otherwise the updater may screw itself up and BREAK your image).

 These apps are getting their updates:
 - Browser Tamer: 3.4.1 > 3.5.0
 - K-Lite Codecs Pack (which MPC-HC is a part of): 17.6.8 > 17.7.5
 
 In addition, these final changes are also worth mentioning:
 - Adjusted the Explorer shell restarting mechanism once again, completely eliminating the chance of you seeing
   a file window upon restarting on certain devices. The time taken to restart had to be slightly increased for
   this however.
 - Disabled the auto update check and hid the update checking entries in the menus.
